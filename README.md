## My task is to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an .svg file. The application will prompt the user to select color, shape, and provide text for the logo and save the generated svg to file.

Note: There is no starter code for this assignment.


User Story

THEN I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from including: circle, triangle, or square✅

WHEN I am prompted for the shape's color

WHEN I have entered all prompts
THEN an SVG file is created named `logo.svg`✅
